A customizable Firefox theme inspired by [VerticalFox](https://github.com/christorange/VerticalFox), [EdgyArc-fr](https://github.com/artsyfriedchicken/EdgyArc-fr), [Edge-Frfox](https://github.com/bmFtZQ/edge-frfox), [ArcWTF](https://github.com/KiKaraage/ArcWTF), [shimmer](https://github.com/nuclearcodecat/shimmer) and [firefox-csshacks](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks). FlexFox offers extensive flexibility and feature options to enhance your browsing experience.

## What's New

**v2.1.1**  
- Fixed an issue where the native vertical tabs background became transparent in Firefox v137.  
- Added the `uc.flex.disable-native-vertical-tabs-autohide` option to disable auto-collapsing of native vertical tabs when set to true.  

**v2.1.0**  
- Built-in vertical tabs now automatically collapse and expand on hover. Use the `Expand sidebar` button (Alt+Ctrl+Z) to enable this feature.  
- Added a new option `uc.flex.show-pin-tabs-separator-in-expanded-state` to display a separator line in the pinned tabs panel when using native vertical tabs.  
- Fixed an issue where themes couldn't be applied when using built-in vertical tabs, and a bug where the theme background image broke when auto-hiding the bookmarks bar.  
- Users can now create a `uc-user-settings.css` file in the `components` folder to customize FlexFox styles. This file loads after FlexFox and overrides its styles, so custom changes remain intact even after future updates.  
- Native vertical tabs and Sidebery are not yet integrated. Only one can be used at a time.

The sidebar tool button design is based on [firefox-gx](https://github.com/Godiesc/firefox-gx) by @Godiesc. Thanks to @Godiesc for the excellent implementation.  

**v2.0.3**  
- Added `sidebar-positionend` attribute for compatibility with Firefox v138+, with a slight tweak to the width of the new sidebar.

**v2.0.2**  
- Updated `@media` rule for Firefox v137+ compatibility.  

**v2.0.1**  
- Added a 1px border to the top when the window is not maximized.  
- Cleaned up the styles by removing unnecessary rules and comments.  

**v2.0.0**:  
- Completely rewritten core functionality, achieving a 28x speed improvement over the previous version.  
   - The first right-click menu opening after launch now takes just 13ms, matching Firefox's native theme performance.  
   - Opening the "List All Tabs" menu with 205 tabs takes 26ms, also on par with the native theme.  
   - In other words, after this rewrite, v2.0.0 has almost no impact on Firefox's performance.  
- Fixed display issues with the address bar and native vertical tabs in Nightly (v135).
