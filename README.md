## üÜï What's New

**v3.1.7**
- Fixed a timing issue in the native vertical tabs animation. Tab label appearance now syncs properly with the tab width expansion.
- Improved the file size estimation in the PowerShell installer script to more accurately reflect the actual download size.

<details>

<summary>üí¨ <b>Previous Updates</b></summary>

**v3.1.6**
- Users can now create a `uc-custom-content.css` file in the `content` folder to apply custom styles for web content. It is imported at the end of `userContent.css`, allowing it to override previous styles. Since this file is not part of the FlexFox repository, its contents will remain untouched during future updates.
- Restructured the project directory to simplify the update process for users who update via Git clone and pull. This change also lays the foundation for the upcoming install/update script.

**v3.1.5**  
- Reduced unnecessary style rules when the new sidebar is enabled.  
- Fixed a long-standing bug in the classic sidebar where the sidebar would collapse when hovering over the switcher menu.  
_Note: This bug had existed for quite some time. Since its impact was minor and fixing it required a slight performance cost, it was previously left unaddressed. Now that FlexFox has fully transitioned to the new sidebar, this patch closes the chapter on the legacy version with a proper fix._

**v3.1.4**  
- Fine-tuned the positioning of the findbar.

**v3.1.3**  
- Fixed an issue where the findbar failed to display match count when positioned in the bottom-right corner.

**v3.1.2**

- The default position of the findbar has been changed from *top-center-left* to *top-right*. A new string-based preference `uc.flex.findbar-position` has been added:
  - `"top-center-left"` or `"0"` moves the findbar to the previous default location near the top center-left.
  - `"top-right"` or `"1"` places it in the new default location at the top right.
  - `"bottom-right"` or `"2"` sets it to Firefox's original position at the bottom right.
- The `--uc-findbar-top` variable has been removed. Findbar placement is now controlled using `--uc-findbar-x-position` and `--uc-findbar-y-position`, allowing full customization.
- The hardcoded minimum width of the sidebar has been removed. The value is now fully controlled via the `--uc-sidebar-width` variable.

**v3.1.1**

- Updated the default animation for collapsing/expanding Sidebery to `ease-in-out` to match Firefox's native vertical tabs (previously Sidebery used `linear`). Users can customize the transition type via the `--uc-autohide-transition-type` variable in `uc-user-settings.css`.
- The animation type for Firefox's native vertical tabs is now also controlled by `--uc-autohide-transition-type`, allowing user customization.
- Fixed an issue where enabling the `uc.flex.fully-hide-sidebery` option in a non-maximized window would leave unwanted blank space at the edge and cause incorrect Sidebery height.

With this update, all previously missing features from the horizontal tab mode are now fully compatible with Firefox's native vertical tabs. FlexFox v3.1.1 brings complete feature parity, making it seamless for users to switch from the old setup.

**v3.1.0**
- Refactored the structure of `uc-variables.css`. Frequently used and user-customizable variables are now grouped at the top of the file with clearer descriptions.
- Overhauled the logic for overriding the toolbar background color in FlexFox. This update should fully resolve issues with theme background image alignment, transparency handling, and incorrect display when the window is inactive.
- Improved animation smoothness when expanding or collapsing vertical tabs.
- Adjusted the navbar positioning so that its buttons align better with vertical tabs.
- Toggling `uc.flex.allow-addons-to-change-toolbar-color` no longer causes the sidebar to shift vertically.

**v3.0.7**
- Fixed incorrect background highlight for the active tab when using Firefox's native tabs (both horizontal and vertical layouts).  
- Fixed a visual glitch in themes where the background image did not align properly between the navigation bar and bookmarks bar, when the menubar was shown and the bookmarks bar was set to auto-hide.  
- Fixed an issue where the menubar background color did not update correctly when the Firefox window was inactive.

**3.0.6**
- Updated multiple imported styles to their latest versions.  
  - Added a closing animation to the find bar when it loses focus.  
  - Improved behavior to keep the navigation bar visible when various panels are open.  
- Fixed a non-standard syntax to prevent potential bugs and ease future debugging.

**v3.0.5**  
- Fixed the position offset of the sidebar stripe when `uc.flex.allow-addons-to-change-toolbar-color` is enabled.

**v3.0.4**  
- Fixed a typing mistake.  
- Fixed the horizontal offset of the bookmarks toolbar when the new sidebar option `Hide tabs and sidebar` is enabled.

**v3.0.3**  
- Fixed an issue where the sidebar stripe could not expand when `uc.flex.fully-hide-sidebery` was enabled or in fullscreen mode. This update also resolves a transition desync between the sidebar stripe and Sidebery under the same conditions.  
- Corrected a theme color issue where the menu bar displayed an inconsistent background color compared to the navigation toolbar.

**v3.0.2**
- Fixed animation issue when the new sidebar is placed on the right side.  
- Native vertical tabs now use the same expand/collapse speed as Sidebery. You can adjust the speed using the `uc.flex.sidebery-fast-hover-expand` or `uc.flex.sidebery-slow-hover-expand` options, or by directly modifying the `--uc-autohide-*` and `--uc-hover-*` variables to suit your preference.

**v3.0.1**  
- Fixed an issue where the position of the sidebar stripe was incorrect when both `uc.flex.disable-bookmarks-autohide` and the new sidebar were enabled.  
- Fixed an issue where the width of the sidebar stripe displayed incorrectly when both `uc.flex.disable-sidebery-autohide` and the new sidebar were enabled.

**v3.0.0**
- Integrated Firefox's native vertical tabs with Sidebery.
  - When Sidebery is active, the native vertical tabs are automatically hidden. The new sidebar collapses into a slim colored stripe at the top of Sidebery. Hovering over the stripe reveals the sidebar toolbar buttons.
  - When Sidebery is inactive (e.g., when another sidebar tool or extension is opened), the native vertical tabs are shown instead.
  - When using the F1 key to quickly toggle Sidebery, since Sidebery and native vertical tabs share the same width and layout, the switch appears seamless.
  - Supports automatic layout adjustment for both left- and right-sided sidebars, adapting to different UI placements.
- Added a new numeric option `uc.flex.max-visible-vertical-pinned-tabs` (accepted values: 4‚Äì6). This controls how many pinned tabs can be displayed vertically in each column of the native vertical tabs panel. The default is 4. If the number of vertically stacked pinned tabs exceeds this, a scrollbar will appear. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Built-in vertical tabs now automatically collapse and expand on hover. Use the `Expand sidebar` button (Alt+Ctrl+Z) to enable this feature.

> **See this section: [User-Customizable Styles (`uc-user-settings.css`)](https://github.com/yuuqilin/FlexFox?tab=readme-ov-file#-user-customizable-styles-uc-user-settingscss)**

**v2.1.2**  
- Fixed an issue where the bookmarks bar would shift when both native vertical tabs and `uc.flex.disable-bookmarks-autohide` were enabled.  
- Fixed a delay in the URL bar transition when entering fullscreen mode.  

**v2.1.1**  
- Fixed an issue where the native vertical tabs background became transparent in Firefox v137.  
- Added the `uc.flex.disable-native-vertical-tabs-autohide` option to disable auto-collapsing of native vertical tabs when set to true.  

**v2.1.0**  
- Built-in vertical tabs now automatically collapse and expand on hover. Use the `Expand sidebar` button (Alt+Ctrl+Z) to enable this feature.  
- Added a new option `uc.flex.show-pin-tabs-separator-in-expanded-state` to display a separator line in the pinned tabs panel when using native vertical tabs.  
- Fixed an issue where themes couldn't be applied when using built-in vertical tabs, and a bug where the theme background image broke when auto-hiding the bookmarks bar.  
- **Users can now create a `uc-user-settings.css` file in the `components` folder to customize FlexFox styles. This file loads after FlexFox and overrides its styles, so custom changes remain intact even after future updates.**  
- Native vertical tabs and Sidebery are not yet integrated. Only one can be used at a time.  

The sidebar tool button design is based on [firefox-gx](https://github.com/Godiesc/firefox-gx) by @Godiesc. Thanks to @Godiesc for the excellent implementation.  

**v2.0.3**  
- Added `sidebar-positionend` attribute for compatibility with Firefox v138+, with a slight tweak to the width of the new sidebar.  

**v2.0.2**  
- Updated `@media` rule for Firefox v137+ compatibility.  

**v2.0.1**  
- Added a 1px border to the top when the window is not maximized.  
- Cleaned up the styles by removing unnecessary rules and comments.  

**v2.0.0**:  
- Completely rewritten core functionality, achieving a 28x speed improvement over the previous version.  
   - The first right-click menu opening after launch now takes just 13ms, matching Firefox's native theme performance.  
   - Opening the "List All Tabs" menu with 205 tabs takes 26ms, also on par with the native theme.  
   - In other words, after this rewrite, v2.0.0 has almost no impact on Firefox's performance.  
- Fixed display issues with the address bar and native vertical tabs in Nightly (v135).

## ‚ú® Features

### üåü Minimalism

> *Maximize your view.*

- Freely collapse or hide the toolbar and sidebar independently.  
  > *You can freely choose to hide the sidebar, the navigation bar, or both, depending on how you want to organize your workspace.*

- Focus entirely on content when everything is hidden.  
  > *Create clean windows that look like sticky notes on your desktop, making it easy to compare pages side by side without unnecessary browser UI. You can also maximize the page area without entering fullscreen, keeping the desktop environment accessible.*

### üåü Stability

> *Stay steady.*

- UI elements expand without shifting the page layout.  
  > *Collapsed toolbars or sidebars float over the page instead of pushing it aside, avoiding disruptive visual jumps.*

- Tabs stay exactly where they were after unfolding.  
  > *When vertical tabs expand, they smoothly stretch without shifting their positions, so there is no jumping and no need to reposition your mouse.*

### üåü Adaptability

> *Adjusts itself.*

- Automatically hides native tabs when Sidebery is active.  
  > *Prevents redundant UI elements by showing only what is needed.*

- Compatible with different Firefox setups.  
  > *Whether your sidebar is on the left or right, and whether you show the title bar, menu bar, or bookmarks bar, FlexFox adapts without breaking the layout.*

### üåü Flexibility

> *Shape it your way.*

- Quickly enable or disable features through `about:config`.  
  > *You can customize FlexFox to fit your needs by disabling any feature you don't want, while keeping Firefox's original behavior intact.*

- Deep customization through your own user styles.  
  > *FlexFox loads user styles after its own, so you can safely override any setting and keep your changes across future updates.*

> 6. Restart Firefox, then delete `user.js` so that any manual changes made in `about:config` can persist.
> 7. Configure Sidebery:
>    - Open Sidebery settings (gear icon in the sidebar).
>    - Navigate to `Help` > `Import addon data`, then import both `sidebery-settings.json` and `sidebery-styles.json` from the `Sidebery` folder in the downloaded archive.
>    - *Note:* If the settings don‚Äôt apply correctly, try re-importing them.
> 8. *(Optional)* Open `about:config` and search for `uc.flex.` to toggle FlexFox features.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

### üìú User-Customizable Styles (`uc-user-settings.css`)

> [!TIP]
> You can safely override default style variables and rules without modifying the core files.
> 
> To do this:
> 
> 1. Create a new file named `uc-user-settings.css` inside the `components` folder.
> 2. Copy any variables or rules you want to change (e.g., from `uc-variables.css`).
> 3. Paste them into `uc-user-settings.css` and modify them as needed.
> 
> This file will be loaded *after* all built-in styles and will take precedence, ensuring your customizations remain intact even after future updates to FlexFox. 

> üí° If you're copying variables defined inside specific selectors (like `:root` or `:root:has(...)`), be sure to copy the entire block to keep the context intact.
